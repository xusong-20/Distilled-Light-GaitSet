# Distilled Light GaitSet
### Dataset & Preparation
Download [CASIA-B Dataset](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp)

Before training or test, please make sure you have prepared the dataset
the silhouettes after pretreatment **MUST have a size of 64x64**.

Futhermore, you also can test our code on [OU-MVLP Dataset](http://www.am.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/BiometricDB/GaitMVLP.html).
